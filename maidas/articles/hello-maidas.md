# Hello MAiDAS

This is the first article on the MAiDAS reference site.

MAiDAS (Markdown AI Data Access Standard) is a protocol that lets AI agents read and write web data as Markdown — no HTML, no JavaScript, just structured text.

## How It Works

1. Discover the site via `/.well-known/index.md`
2. Read schemas to understand resource structure
3. Browse lists with pagination and filtering
4. Fetch individual documents

All data is exchanged as `text/markdown; charset=utf-8`.
